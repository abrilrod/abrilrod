I'm a UX/UI designer and frontend developer passionate about creating visual experiences that blend functionality and aesthetics, bringing together the best of design and code. I'm always exploring new techniques and expanding my skills in both areas. I love sharing what I learn and finding creative ways to grow within the tech world.

* **I'm interested in web development, UX/UI design, graphic design, teaching, and content creation.**

- Outside tech, 📖 I love to read and write novels, 🎮 playing videogames (specially The Sims 4 and Minecraft), and 🎵 listen to music.
